gulp-octo-buycraft
==================

A gulp script for aiding Buycraft theme development.

## Note
Does not include any HTML files (required) at this time, whilst I wait upon an
official statement from Buycraft on the legality of me including local copies
of the generated HTML for a buycraft page.

If I am unable to include it, I will write a script to download the page
automatically, or find another compromise with the BuyCraft team.

To add the HTML yourself, simply ```wget``` a page, and change all references
to /assets/ to be prefixed with your store URL.
